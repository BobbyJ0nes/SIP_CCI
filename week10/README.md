# Week 10: Simple Particle System

## Notes

Basic particle system - took the course examples and made simple falling particles.

### What it does:
- ArrayList of particles
- Each particle has position, velocity, acceleration (3 vectors ✓)
- Mouse click adds 5 particles
- Hold W for wind force (randomized ✓)
- R key resets
- Simple circles, autumn colors

### Forces:
- Gravity: pulls down
- Wind: when W pressed, pushes sideways

### Built from course examples:
- Used basic particle_system.pde structure
- Particle class with 3 PVectors
- addForce() method 
- ArrayList management - backwards loop for removal

Simple and works. Meets Week 10 requirements.
