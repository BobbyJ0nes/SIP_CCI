# Sound and Image Processing Portfolio

## Overview
Portfolio of interactive Processing sketches exploring sound and image processing concepts. Each week focuses on different techniques from pixel manipulation to particle systems.

## AI Usage
AI (Gemini 2.5 PRO) was used to help understand concepts and course material. Typical prompt: *"You are a Processing developer, help me understand this concept. Give snippets from the processing documentation where possible"* followed by asking for explanations of code in pseudo-code format. AI was used for understanding purposes.
